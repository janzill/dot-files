Setup all your config files in a git repo, BRILLIANT!

Installation
============

To install the main config files into your $HOME directory just download the clone and link script and run using ruby

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlc/dot-files/master/clone_and_link.rb | ruby

If you aren't comfortable with running arbitary scripts directly off the internet (which you shouldn't be) download
the file, inspect it and run it manually.

After running this you will have a working set of config files linked into your home directory from their actual 
location at ~/.dot-files/files. Restart your bash session to get everything loaded up
